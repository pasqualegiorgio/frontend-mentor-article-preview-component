## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markups
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive development
- [Vanilla JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to show a mini-popup on the click of a button in Vanilla JavaScript, that means without any framework, library o plugin to help me doing that.

### Continued development

I can improve my JavaScript skills in order to write better code. The code I wrote it's ok and works, but I think I can do better than that.
Moreover, I can be more accurate in the style development.

### Useful resources
